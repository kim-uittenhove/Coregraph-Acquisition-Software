# Trail Making Test Analysis
Feature extraction code accompanying the paper: *"Dual-Component Analysis of Trail Making Test: Task vs. Movement Coordination "*.

## Overview
This repository contains Python scripts for extracting cognitive task and movement coordination features from kinematic data recorded with a digital pen tablet during the Trail Making Test (TMT). 
The code is organized into sequential analysis steps, each building on the results of the previous step.

## Installation
